      <h1>Current Research Projects:</h1>
       </div>
      <h1>1. Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)</h1>
      <p>Coastal regions across the country and around the world are exposed to a wide range of natural hazards, many of which are increasing in frequency and intensity. ICoM tackles key uncertainties associated with the evolution of coastal systems by developing and applying computational models that can simulate the complex multiscale processes and interactions, with an initial focus on the Mid-Atlantic coast and the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay watersheds.
      
      
      
      <h1>2. Penn State Initiative for Resilient Communities (PSIRC)</h1>
      <p>Building partnerships with local stakeholders and state agencies, PSIRC brings together a diverse transdisciplinary team to understand and address the complex challenges associated with flood resilience in Pennsylvania riverine communities.
      
      <h1>3. Mid-Atlantic Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (MARISA)</h1>
      <p>MARISA helps Mid-Atlantic communities become more resilient to a changing climate through improved data, place-based decision support, and public engagement. Established in September 2016, MARISA supports integrated, flexible processes for building adaptive capacity to climate variability and change in diverse settings in the Mid- Atlantic region, with an initial focus on the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
