      <p>Hi, welcome to my world. My name is Suhail Mahmud, an Atmospheric Data Scientist and HPC/AI enthuiastic working to solve the world's complex problems (and hopefully solve them along the way)</p>

<p>My educational background is in Computational Science, which i have Master's and Phd in from University of Texas at Elpaso. My Doctorate thesis was on the topic of "Optimization Of Regional Scale Numerical Weather Prediction & Air Quality Model For The Paso Del Norte Region"

My research is directly related to climate models, atmospheric science, meteorology, and atmospheric dynamics, multi-sector dynamics. Another important goal of the research was to model the vertical profile of pollutants and other meteorological parameters using different satellite-based data (Sounder profile, Lidar) and launching ozonesonde and radiosonde into the atmosphere to retrieve meteorological data.

I am proficient at handling, analyzing, and processing meteorological and geospatial datasets from different sources in various formats, such as NetCDF, GRIB, HDF, etc. Conducting comprehensive statistical and numerical analysis with Fortran, Python, R, and Matlab was also part of my job responsibilities as a research assistant.I have an in-depth understanding of algorithms, have a great mastery of data visualization using MatLab and Python, and have proficiency in Python data libraries like the panda, NumPy and SciPy, R and Corresponding libraries, SQL. I am equally experienced in the Linux environment and High performance computing cluster with AWS due to my research-oriented nature. Applying different parallel computing methods like MPI, OpenMP were also part of my research interest.</p>

      <p>Over the past years, I have been lucky enough to publish several peer-reviewed scientific papers. 
          The research page of this website is a great way to check out the research projects I conducted or was apart of.</p>
